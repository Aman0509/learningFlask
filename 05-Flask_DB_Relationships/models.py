"""
- Often for larger projects you will have multiple Models.
- These models may have a relationship to each other.
- To understand model relationships, we need to review Primary Keys and Foreign Keys in tables.
- Primary Key
    - A Primary Key is a unique identifier for each row in a table.
- Foreign Key
    - A Foreign Key is a unique identifier for each row in another table. In other words, primary key in another table.
- Example
    - Puppy Table
        - ID Tag (Primary Key)
        - Puppy Name
    - Owner Table
        - National ID Number (Primary Key)
        - Owner Name
        - Puppy ID (Foreign Key)
- Later on we will discuss more complex relationships.
- For now, letâ€™s work through an example of connecting 2 tables together by connecting their respective models in the application .py script.
